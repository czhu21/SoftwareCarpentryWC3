# SoftwareCarpentryWC3
Casey Zhu Software Carpentry Weekly Challenge 3
This project is to get exposure to git and web development, as well as some basic Python.
The website is based on a basic Jekyll template.
The first Python script prints a simple message to the terminal.
The second Python script adds all of the even numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive and exclusive) and prints the results to the terminal.
